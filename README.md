## Menu Code Test

### `Live version:`
http://tishayaem.github.io/menu-code-test-react-cra

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

#### To do:
###### Code:
  - Complete full test coverage with Jest and Enzyme
  - Unit test each component with special attention to restaurant rules and possibly do end2end testing with Cypress.
  - Refactor `restaurantRules()` function for better testability.
  - Take full control of radio buttons' state. Get rid of the console error.
###### UI:
  - Ask user if guests would like to pay together or individually. Show or hide joint order amount depending on the choice.
  -  Show order confirmation
  -  Show list of ordered dishes above the price
  - Improve visual appearance, make the app fully responsive.

  ### Comments

  - Struggling to run Jest and Enzyme with original webpack and babel config I decided to create a new configuration with create-react-app to save time.
